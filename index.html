    <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
    <p>I have a lot of hobbies! In my free time I love to paint, do puzzles, embroider, knit, and hike. My favorite place to be is at the beach, but more specifically, I love New England and Hawaii the most! My family and I have always loved the outdoors and have spent many a summer day camping near the coast. We love new adventures!</p>
    <h2>My Interests</h2>
    <p>I have a deep interest in learning to paint in Photoshop. I also love creating composited art in Photoshop. Off the computer I like learning about history, espescially war history.</p>
    <h2>My Career Goals</h2>
    <p>It is my hope to become a proficient web and graphic designer. I would like to find a job that allows for at least part time work from home. I see my self working for a fast paced marketing company that is open to new and inovated ideas. My goals after graduation are as follows:
        <ol type="1">
            <li>Land an amazing job!</li>
            <li>Pay off student loans.</li>
